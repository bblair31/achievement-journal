#### Re-introduce fallback location for candidates in rediscovery ([link](https://app.clickup.com/t/86add3ka5))

- **Folder:** Product
- **List:** Delivery
- **Created:** Invalid Date
- **Updated:** Invalid Date
- **Closed:** Invalid Date

Background
Given we leverage location of most recent app as a fallback for candidates when they don't have one set, we want to re-introduce that to the rediscovery UI (and maybe more generally) but give it a visual treatemtn like the attached design that flags that to the user. The belief is users may see that once, understand it and move on, so we don't want it to overwhelm the UI.

Acceptance Criteria
Given I am a user reviewing candidates
When a candidate doesn't have a location set on their profile but they do have application history
Then I should see their location displayed based on their most recent app with an info icon as designed
And When I hover on the icon
Then I should see text that says "Candidate location unavailable; defaulting to the facility location of their last application."

Design (feel free to wrap text)

AC
Duplicate 1-step apply flow from opportunity rec8dmG0GnO9xPzJC and add to event rec6jmhUvFceBxriX. There is currently no new opportunity created for this event

#### Distance between position and candidate location appearing incorrectly ([link](https://app.clickup.com/t/86acx0fk9))

- **Folder:** Product
- **List:** Delivery
- **Created:** Invalid Date
- **Updated:** Invalid Date
- **Closed:** Invalid Date

Steps to re-create
Review role in washington heights
Scroll candidate list to find candidate in mount vernon, ny and bronx, ny

Expected behavior
See distance of ~30 miles and <10 miles

Actual behavior
See distance of 49 miles and 52 miles (ingested opportunity is associated with washington heights suburb vs washington heights, manhattan)


Notes
It looks like the opportunity is being associated with the washington heights suburb instead of the city. Does it make sense for us to list primary locations for our customers this way ingestion has a bit more context on where to associate with?

#### Backfill email/SMS sources to be not system-specific ([link](https://app.clickup.com/t/86acvqd82))

- **Folder:** Product
- **List:** Delivery
- **Created:** Invalid Date

**Background**
Currently, in the admin app candidate drawer, we display the details of a candidates' Email/SMS activity for super admins only. 
For "regular" admin app users, we do not display any additional data beyond the event type (Ex. "Email sent", "Email opened", etc.) since some of the email titles have system-specific information. 

We want to backfill these email and sms activity source s (the column where the email title is stored) so that these titles are not specific to a system and we can display these to all users. 

This will require us to backfill via Segment, so that Segment writes these updated titles to their respective BQ tables. 

Below are the list of email titles we want to update:
 

Users who are associated with an email title in t he above list in any of their email/sms activity, should have their Segment events related to these email/sms activities backfilled.

Background
Based on feedback from AHS and walking through our product with others, it is clear that having limited context on the activity feed details makes it less valuable. As a result, we want to enable all users to see email names (or subject lines) where they exist. This task will also include backfilling/updating historical records to remove references to systems

Acceptance Criteria
Given I am a system (non super-admin) user in the admin platform
When I am reviewing a candidate's activity feed
Then I should see the messaging name (like super admins do)
And I should not see any reference to system names (see spreadsheet for updates)

Note: Admin recruiters should not see text message content

Match score incorporates candidate location by check either the location set on a candidate or falling back to see if a candidate recently applied to a role (application history) and using the location as a proxy. In the match results, we show the location of the candidates even if we used the fallback value from application history. This is somewhat confusing because when you click to see the candidate detail, their locations are often blank.
Example
Go to  
See that "Aminah Kaba" has a location listed in the table
Click on candidate
See that they do not have a location listed in the drawer (their application history does have a recent application in the location listed in the table)

Suggested change
Only show location in the match if we have a candidate.location (not exact field name), otherwise, keep it blank.
ALT: italicize the proxied location and/or add small subtext that says "taken from/based on recent application"
Ensure the candidate summary incorporates a sentence explaining that the recent application was used as a proxy to match them - "Previously applied to a role in Morristown, NJ."

Pass some of the NY Cancer raw Resume text through our importer and see how it looks. Maybe "resume parsing" is just the OCR/file piece, then "magic parser" kicks in

Where we get resumes:
users directly upload their resumes via our registration flow - how/when do we parse/process
as a column in the application history as raw text (already "parsed")
exports from places like jazzhr or dump of resume pdfs directly from customers
-----
Assume resumes may be imported through our candidate import flow (that accepts CSVs today) in addition to candidates directly providing resumes themselves. 
How do we merge data? How do we create new users? 
Zach question that we also want to consider - can we process uploaded resumes and autofill their registration at sign up? (i.e. AHS has 18 questions they want to ask every user - a lot is resume information) - do a cost analysis and how near "realtime" could it be. Users accept or update
What do we do with past-applicant-data that has resume_text? Force admin users to import them? Onetime backfill processing of any existing users with their resume data (by email)?

We've found that WorkUp-Parser-Magic can take in long resume text/strings provided by customers in past-applicant-data  and parse it into valid profile data with very minimal code change. We'll "re-import" any existing WorkUp users' resumes from the past application data. Non-existing users will be addressed alongside  

Steps
Add "diffing" and "recency checks" strategy when importing users so that we don't overwrite OR create a bunch of duplicate data like we do now on user re-imports
(Once the diffing step is complete and deployed) Export from BigQuery all resume text for any existing users and re-import them through our Platform

Notes
Focus on non-registration use case first (e.g. upload past job applicants for NY Cancer)
Registration could take upwards of 20 sec to save to candidate profile fields

Background
For the MetLife event, we need to capture some custom information from candidates. We determined that everything besides contact info/name would be handled via our standard registration flow and everything else would be an apply flow.

Acceptance Criteria
At the completion of this task, we should see:

Creation of apply flow to capture information as designed/requested by AHS
Values for all dropdowns are in the Figma
Careers of interest is a search select - one option

Been seeing inconsistencies with our candidate export. Examples:
Hudson was exporting ALL results from the UMP candidates page candidates with a status of Engaged or a status of Interested. Two different exports had two different results. Candidates without those statuses set were in the export (e.g. oliviakocko555@gmail.com)
Terry was exporting ALL results from UMP candidates page for filtered candidates where source name was "Candidates Import - 2025.12 UMP New Rediscovery Candidates (APP, imaging, OT, PT) - workup upload (1)". Each export had different results.

Initial thought -- could multiple tabs with varying applied filters be causing conflict with filters stored in local storage? Or is our filtering just not setup/working as we'd expect?

currently, many past applicants do not show up on the candidates page and only show in rediscovery (they are not "candidates with events" which is needed to show on candidates page). fix this so we show all candidates.

Dates not fully parsing as expected (work history, education history, licensing)
 Job descriptions potentially not saved?
  Certification dates are just displayed as unknown - if they are truly unknown, we should hide this

How can our parsed data processing be improved if/when this information properly comes through from the parser? (feel free to identify opportunities that may take more work beyond a single task)

#### User reviewing events should see hyperlinked registrant # ([link](https://app.clickup.com/t/86advjfdy))

Background
It seems like a lot of our users are trying to access the info on candidates signing up for events and our UX isn't clear on how to get there. What we want to do in future iterations and what would make the most sense is to hyperlink the # shown for registrants/sign up and when a user clicks that they get taken to the events view with a filtered view of candidates.

Acceptance Criteria
Given I am a user looking at the events table (on the events page or dashboard)
When I see an event with >0 sign ups
Then I should see that number hyperlinked
...
And When I click that number
Then I should be taken to the events page with a filtered view of candidates that signed up for that events
